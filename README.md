# Whole Genome Duplication Analysis Scripts
These scripts attempt to determine whether or not there is any support for a shared whole genome duplication between two taxa based on their transcriptomes.

## Dependencies
1. [TransDecoder](http://sourceforge.net/projects/transdecoder/files/OLDER/TransDecoder_r20140704.tar.gz/download)
	* Used to determine likely open reading frames in a given transcriptome and its corresponding protein translation.
2. [Blat](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/)
	* Used to determine likely paralogs.
3. [KaKs_Calculator](https://code.google.com/p/kaks-calculator/downloads/list)
	* Used to estimate the number of synonymous substitions per synonymous site (Ks) between paralogs.
4. [ProteinOrtho.pl](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/proteinortho/)
	* Used to identify orthologous sequences shared across the given transcriptomes.
5. [Blastp](http://1.usa.gov/1zTP2u6)
	* Used by ProteinOrtho.pl to detect orthologs. Also used to reduce orthologous sequences to only their shared homologous sites.
6. [MUSCLE](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm)
	* Used to align orthologous family sequences after reduction to homologous sites.
6. [RAxML](https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML)
	* Used to calculate best tree for a quartet as well as its support.
7. [R](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
	* Plotting and statistics software used to generate the actual Ks plot.

# wgd-test.pl
## Script Workflow
Transcriptomes given to the script are first translated into their most likely protein using TransDecoder. An intraspecies all versus all blat search is then performed for for each input transcriptome in order to identify homologous protein pairs. Ks is then calculated for each protein pair using KaKs_Calculator. Pairs are then filtered to the Ks range specified by the user. Quartets are then identified by taking one sequence from each pair found in the specified Ks range in each transcriptome and running ProteinOrtho. Alignments are restricted to homologous sites only using blastp, homologous sites are then aligned using MUSCLE. If the final protein alignment meets the required length cutoff (100 amino acids/300 nucleotides), the sequence is reverse translated to its original nucleotide sequence. RAxML is then used to run a 100 replicate rapid bootstrap using the GTR-Gamma model. If the support of the quartet split is high enough (>= 70 by default), this quartet's topology is used as evidence for whether or not the given transcriptomes shared a whole genome duplication.

## Script Usage & Settings
### Usage
At the mininmum, the script requires two FASTA files specfied with -t or --transcriptomes to run, the desired Ks range over which to check for a shared WGD must also specified for each transcriptome using -k or --ks:

```
wgd-test.pl -t transcriptome1.fa transcriptome2.fa -k 0.2-0.6,0.3-0.7 
```

If only one Ks range is given as in the following invocation, this range is used for both transcriptomes:

```
wgd-test.pl -t transcriptome1.fa transcriptome2.fa -k 0.2-0.6
```
